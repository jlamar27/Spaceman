## Game Logic

The game JavaScript file (main.js) handles the core logic of the "Who's That Pokemon" game. It randomly selects a Pokemon name, displays blanks for each letter, handles user guesses, tracks remaining guesses, and displays win/loss messages.

The game uses data from the pokemonArray defined in pokemon.js, which includes Pokemon names and hints.
